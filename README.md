# -PLC-PID-LEVEL-CONTROL
**PID Level Control** is a PLC based industrial application for controling the water level in a tank with a PID controller.Tia portal V15 has been used for the programing.
Factory i/o has been used for the 3D simulation. S7-PLCSIM has been used instead of a real PLC.

## Main Idea







## Devices

- **PLC**:  `S7-1200`,

    **CPU**: `1211C DC/DC/DC`,

    **Description** : Work memory 50 KB; 24VDC power supply with DI6 x 24VDC SINK/ SOURCE, DQ4 x 24VDC and AI2 on
board;3 high-speed counters (expandable with digital signal board) and 4 pulse outputs on board; signal board expands on-board I/O; up to 3 communication modules for serial communication; 0.04 ms/1000 instructions; PROFINET interface for programming, HMI and PLC to PLC communication

- **HMI**: `TP700 Comfort`
